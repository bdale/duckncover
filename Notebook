- rail buttons.  Terry's trailer uses 1515, the Kloudbusters uses Unistrut,
  both have 20' rails.  I have plenty of 1515 buttons that use a 1/4-20 screw.

  Aerocon sells unistrut rail buttons for $12 each plus shipping.  They're 
  turned from Delrin, for 1/4-20 stainless flat head screws.  They provide
  a drawing I saved as unistrut-button.gif.  McMaster sells 1-1/4" Delrin
  rod for $8.53 per foot in white or $9.32 per foot in black.  

  Sure seems like I could buy some Delrin rod and cut plenty of buttons on 
  my lathe for cheap if we want to use the Kloudbuster's trailer!

- the WSMR Museum is closed at least until Sept 22, except the missile garden
  can be visited with military ID.  Sent email asking if they have any 
  drawings, or would be willing to allow me to visit specifically to take
  measurements of the prototype.

- Dave Fitch provided a pile of photos and drawings

- Peter Alway invived me to phone him for more info

- line cutters for dual deploy from one airframe break:

  A pair of those on a piece of para cord holding in a deployment bag
  fired by redundant altimeters at the same main deploy altitude sure
  feels like a robust main deployment choice from a single airframe break
  as long as the means of releasing the nose cone at apogee doesn't impart
  more acceleration than para cord can tolerate.

- Bob Brown asks that we use 1515 buttons as they really don't want us flying
  a research "O" from Buster (the launch trailer with unistrut rail).  Should
  be fine, as mass will be lower than Meh-ga Nuke which flew successfully on
  1515s.
